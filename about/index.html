<p><b>I’m Eduardo Hernández, I’m from México 🇲🇽 and I’m a software engineer! 👾</b></p>

<p>I’ve had the luck and pleasure of contributing on web applications from zero-to-production, where
the biggest challenge was to add value as soon as possible to get a deliverable and satisfy the
business needs. On the other hand, I’ve been part of well established projects, with more than
5 years running, with more elaborated process, many concurrent customers and a bigger engineering
team  (~60 👨🏽‍💻👩🏻‍💻).</p>

<p>One of the qualities that might describe me better, is that I’m a very curious person who really
enjoys understanding how things work. It helps me get a sense of what I’m doing and feeling  more
confident. I try to drive my curiosity by investing in my learning and applying whenever I can what
I learn in practice and sharing with others.</p>
